The species of teletubby called Dipsy is actually Tubby Dipsus.
They have a lot in common with other teletubbies.
Dipsy's are typically found in the wasteland also called "Dipsy Land".
The underground cities there are entirely built by Dipsy's, this makes them
the best diggers possible. One other thing everyone should know about Dipsy's
is that they tend to be rather mischiveous, and some are Pure evil... these are
known as "Evil Dipsy's" and are quite common.

I apologise for my spelling mistakes.
